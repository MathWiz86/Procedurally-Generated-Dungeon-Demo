# Procedurally Generated Dungeon Demo
A demo of a procedurally generatd dungeon in Unity, created with Braxton DeHate for a CS project.

I was responsible for the initial dungeon generation, decoration rules, and debug tile data.

This was made with the help of [Braxton DeHate](https://github.com/BraxtonDeHate "Braxton DeHate"), who worked on the mesh generation for the dungeon via the use of Perlin Noise.

# How To Open The Project
This project is able to be opened on Unity 2021.1 and later.
